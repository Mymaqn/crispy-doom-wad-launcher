# A crispy doom WAD launcher
A very simplistic WAD launcher for Crispy Doom

# Requirements
Powershell

# Installation
Copy the gui.ps1 script along with launcher.bat into your Crispy doom folder
Then run launcher.bat, which will take you through a first time set up, where you get to choose the location of all you WADs
You can create a shortcut for launcher.bat somewhere if you don't want to go into the folder to run Crispy Doom every time.

# Manual config set up
If you have WADs scattered over multiple setups you might want to do some manual configuration. Open launcher.cfg in a text editor. Then add your WADs manually. The syntax is as follows:
nameForWAD;PathForWAD
